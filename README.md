# Common Issues
On Linux and macOS, if the executable cannot be opened or appears as garbled text, try:
  
1. Open a terminal where the file is located
2. Execute "sudo chmod +x 'Deacon_Project_CLICalculator_Linux'"
3. Execute "./'Deacon_Project_CLICalculator_Linux'"

Note: This method is not tested on macOS, but it is tested and had worked on Linux (Ubuntu).
